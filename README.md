# Coffee Price Prediction
Use linear regression and stochastic gradient descent to predict the price of coffee 
with a specific size (oz).

# Usage
Run the main.py script from the root directory: `python3 main.py --size 12`
> Note: include the `--size` argument to select the coffee size (oz). The script 
will predict the price of this size.
